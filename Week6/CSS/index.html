        <h2>1. A Paragraph for HKBU (from Wikipedia)</h2>
        <p class="hkbu_info">Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) is a publicly funded tertiary liberal arts[1] institution with a Christian education heritage. It was established as Hong Kong Baptist College with the support of American Baptists, who provided both operating and construction funds and personnel to the school in its early years. It became a public college in 1983.
            It became Hong Kong Baptist University in 1994 during the presidency of Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai, LLD, GBS, CBE, JP, who succeeded the Founding President, Dr. Lam Chi-fung,[2] as the second president of the University in 1971. After 30 years of services to the University, Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai retired in 2001 and Prof. Ng Ching-fai, GBS, was appointed as the third president of the University. In 2010, Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi assumed office as the fourth president of HKBU. In 2015, Prof. Roland Chin was appointed as the fifth President of HKBU. On 1 February 2021, Prof. Alexander Ping-kong Wai became the sixth President and Vice-Chancellor of HKBU.
                
            HKBU has five main campuses: Ho Sin Hang Campus (1966), Shaw Campus (1995), Baptist University Road Campus (1998), Kai Tak Campus (2005), and Shek Mun Campus (2006) for the College of International Education and the Hong Kong Baptist University Affiliated School Wong Kam Fai Secondary and Primary School. The first three campuses are located in the urban heart of Kowloon Tsai, while the Kai Tak Campus is located on Kwun Tong Road and the Shek Mun Campus in the Shek Mun area of Sha Tin District near Shek Mun station.
                
            In 2005, the University established the Beijing Normal University â€“ Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC) in Zhuhai, China. The college was the first tertiary education institution founded through collaboration between a Mainland university and a Hong Kong university.

        <h2>2. History for HKBU (from Wikipedia)</h2>
        <p class="hkbu_hist">
            The Hong Kong Baptist College was opened on 11 September 1956 on the premises of the Pui Ching Middle School, a Baptist-affiliated secondary school, with an initial enrolment of 152 students.[3] In 1957 the government gave the college land on Waterloo Road to build a permanent campus, which was completed in 1966.[3]

            The Hong Kong Baptist College Bill 1983 was passed by the Legislative Council on 10 August 1983.[4] The college previously fell under the purview of the Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance and received funding from the Education Department. After this bill became law, the college instead began to receive funding from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee.[5]
            
            The third reading of the Hong Kong Baptist College (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 16 November 1994, transforming the college into the Hong Kong Baptist University.[6][7]
